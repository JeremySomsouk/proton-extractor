## ⚡ What It Does

```
$ proton-extractor ~/Downloads/calendar-2026-*.ics

--- February 2026 ---
  2h 30m  Childcare [Lulu]
  2h 30m  Childcare [Jeremy]
  4h      Meeting & Signature [Client]
  ------
  9h      Lulu
  9h      Jeremy
  18h     TOTAL

=== Grand Total: 47h ===
=== Hours per person ===
  22h 30m  Lulu
  24h 30m  Jeremy
```

No exports. No spreadsheets. No manual counting.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
cargo install --git https://github.com/JeremySomsouk/proton-extractor

# Run on your Proton Calendar exports
proton-extractor ~/Downloads/calendar.ics

# Filter to current month
proton-extractor ~/Downloads/*.ics -d current

# Previous month only
proton-extractor ~/Downloads/*.ics -d previous
```

## 💡 Features

### 📅 Smart Parsing
- Parses standard `.ics` files from Proton Calendar exports
- Extracts **person names** from `[PersonName]` in event titles
- Handles **recurring events** (RRULE) with 5-year look-ahead
- Respects **exclusion dates** (EXDATE)
- Skips zero/negative duration events automatically

### 📊 Time Reports
- **Per-month breakdown** with event details
- **Per-person totals** — see who's working on what
- **Grand totals** across all files
- **Multiple files** supported — glob patterns work
- **Export filtered events** to `.ics` format for re-importing

### 🎯 Use Cases

```
# Freelancers: Track client time
proton-extractor client-calendar.ics

# Babysitter: Log hours for parents
proton-extractor babysitter-calendar.ics -m previous

# Families: Split childcare between parents
proton-extractor ~/Downloads/*-calendar.ics
```

## ⚙️ Usage

| Flag | Values | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `-d, --date` | `all`, `current`, `previous`, `today`, `week` | Filter by date period |
| `-f, --format` | `text`, `json`, `csv`, `markdown`, `ical` | Output format |
| `--exclude-person` | name | Exclude events by person |
| `-p, --person` | name | Filter by person |
| `--project` | name | Filter by project (see {project} tags) |
| `--from` | YYYY-MM-DD | Start date |
| `--to` | YYYY-MM-DD | End date |
| `--list-persons` | | List all unique persons found in events |

### Event Format

Proton Extractor looks for person names in brackets and projects in curly braces:

```
✅ "Meeting with [Alice] {Project Alpha}"  → Person: Alice, Project: Alpha
✅ "Childcare [Jeremy] {Family}"            → Person: Jeremy, Project: Family
✅ "Stand-up"                              → Person: (none), Project: (none)
```

**Tip:** Use Proton Calendar's description field to tag events with `[PersonName]` and `{ProjectName}`.
